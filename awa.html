                         influences within shared living spaces. Previous studies have demonstrated 
                         that communication style mismatches often exacerbate conflicts among roommates,
                          while avoiding confrontation can lead to prolonged issues and deteriorated relationships <span style="color: white;">(Burgos-Calvillo et al., 2024).</span> 
                          This understanding guided the development of Awa, which 
                          emphasizes effective communication, structured conflict management, 
                          and personality-based roommate matching.

                        <br> <br>Drawing on these findings, the app encourages open dialogue, making it easier
                         for roommates to address issues like cleaning schedules, guest policies, and noise levels,
                          thus fostering a harmonious living environment <span style="color: white;">(Abela et al., 2023)</span> . By integrating these 
                          sociological insights, Awa is designed to mitigate common sources of conflict and enhance 
                          overall roommate satisfaction.The Awa app is rooted in extensive research on roommate dynamics,
                           focusing on conflict resolution, personality compatibility, and cultural influences within shared
                            living spaces.

                        <br> <br>  That said, this remains the long-term vision 
                        of the platform. At present, our team has focused on delivering 
                        the core MVP: chores, bill-splitting, shopping lists, and chat 
                        functionality—the basic infrastructure that every shared household needs.
                         Over time, we hope to move beyond “task coordination” 
                         into relationship-aware coordination. For example, we plan to collect
                          users’ MBTI personality types and lightly integrate cultural insights 
                        so that households can better understand each other’s expectations.


                         <br> <br> A simple case might be 
                         <br> <br> <i>Fatima is an INTJ. If she withdraws after a long day, it doesn’t mean she dislikes her roommates—it’s just her way of recharging. Respecting her 
                         quiet time makes shared moments more enjoyable later</i>

                         <br> <br> <i>Alex is an ENFP. He thrives on spontaneous hangouts and may
                             invite friends over. A quick heads-up about noise levels or
                             guest policies helps keep the vibe fun without crossing boundaries.</i>
                        
                <br> <br>
                By presenting these kinds of personality and cultural insights in 
                plain language, Awa aims to make roommates more empathetic toward each 
                other’s differences, 
                so that small misunderstandings don’t grow into lasting conflicts.

                <h2 class="section-title">Features and Functionality</h2>
                <div class="section-content">

                    <h3 style="color: white;">Understanding Roommate Dynamics</h3>
                    <p>These are the features we’ve focused on first—the everyday essentials that make co-living smoother:
                    <br>  <br> <strong>Bills & Payments - </strong> Housemates can log bills (one-time or 
                     recurring, like rent or utilities). Whoever pays first records the
                      amount and items covered. The cost is then split evenly—including 
                      the payer—and invoices are generated automatically. Each roommate 
                      reimburses the payer directly (outside the app), but Awa manages 
                      payment confirmations: once the payer marks reimbursements as received, 
                     the bill is officially closed.


                    <br>  <br> <strong>Shopping Lists - </strong>Supports multiple 
                    concurrent lists like groceries, yard supplies, or even holiday 
                    decorations. Anyone can add or remove items. Selected items can be
                     staged into a payment list, which seamlessly generates a bill and 
                     invoice—so if someone picks up groceries, the cost is split instantly. 
                    Future updates will include auto-parsing of receipts.

                    
                    <br>  <br> <strong>Tasks & Chores - </strong>Easily assign tasks to 
                    housemates with due dates. The assigned person is notified and can mark 
                    tasks complete, 
                    helping track fairness and accountability in daily chores.

                     <br>  <br> <strong>Chat & Messaging - </strong>Classic group messaging with 
                     timestamps, plus reactions that work like toggles
                      (tap again to remove or change your emoji). 
                      An anonymous chat option (later sprints update) lets roommates
                      raise sensitive issues without fear of confrontation.

                          <br>  <br> <strong>Misc features</strong>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Multi-currency support.</li>
                            <li>Room invite codes (with option to deactivate 
                                and regenerate)</li>
                                <li>Store each housemate’s Interac email in-app for quick transfers.</li>
                          <li>A clean dashboard shows summaries of chores, shopping items, 
                            and bills at a glance so roommates 
                            always know what’s pending..</li>
                            </ul>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Tech Stack and Architecture</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>For the backend of Awa, I’ve used <span style="color: white;">Spring Boot</span> as the primary framework. Spring Boot provides a robust, 
                        scalable environment that simplifies backend development, enabling rapid setup and integration 
                        with various components. It is particularly suited for handling <span style="color: white;">REST APIs</span>, making it an ideal 
                        choice for an app like Awa, which requires smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
                         The app’s data is stored in <span style="color: white;">MongoDB</span>, a NoSQL database that offers flexibility in handling dynamic 
                         data models. MongoDB's scalability and ease of integration with Spring Boot ensure efficient handling 
                         of the app’s user data, tasks, 
                        and financial records.</p>

                    <p>On the frontend, <span style="color: white;">Flutter</span> is the chosen framework for building a responsive, cross-platform 
                        app. Flutter’s ability to compile to both Android and iOS from a single codebase significantly
                         reduces development time and maintenance overhead. Its rich widget-based UI system allows for 
                         smooth, customizable interfaces that can deliver a pleasant user 
                        experience across different devices.</p>

                        <p>As for <span style="color: white;">data security</span>, sensitive user information, including passwords and financial data, 
                            is protected using <span style="color: white;">BCrypt</span> for password hashing and <span style="color: white;">JWT(JSON Web Tokens)</span> for secure authentication. 
                            These tools ensure that user 
                            data is encrypted and securely transmitted between the frontend and backend.</p>

                            <p>
                                The app is fully dockerized for easy deployment and scalability, 
                                ensuring a consistent environment across development and production. 
                                At the moment, it is hosted on Render, giving us reliable cloud-based 
                                performance during the MVP stage. Looking ahead, we plan to migrate hosting
                                 to Brimble, a platform tailored for African developers, to take advantage 
                                 of its localized infrastructure and support for scaling 
                                in markets where co-living solutions like Awa are most needed.

                <h2 class="section-title">User Experience & Interface Design</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Àwa plays on both the English word <span style="color: white;">"Our"</span> and the Yoruba word for <span style="color: white;">"us"</span>, capturing the spirit of togetherness at the heart of shared living. It is designed to feel warm, 
                        expressive, and human—a roommate app that understands logistics don’t have to be boring, but about navigating shared life with empathy and ease. We leaned into a playful,
                         vibrant visual language that breaks away from the sterile tone of most task or finance apps. The interface is filled with color, illustrations, 
                        and conversational cues, making the user feel welcomed, not overwhelmed—because in the end, Àwa isn’t just about tasks, it’s about us.</p> <br> <br>

                    <p><span style="color: white;">Typography</span> : We chose <span style="color: white;">Darker Grotesque and Boulder</span> for their bold, clean personalities. 
                        Dark Grotesque brings clarity and structure, while Boulder adds a soft, rounded tone that 
                        feels approachable  , a balance between authority and friendliness.</p>

                    <p><strong>Color Palette & Mood:</strong> The app uses <span style="color: white;">bright blues, bold yellows and deep purples</span>,  to evoke energy and trust. The palette reinforces a sense of movement and personality which is essential for an app designed around daily house life.</p>

                    <p><strong>Illustration & Motion : </strong> From background stickers (pizza slices, detergent bottles, sandals) to interactive elements like “2 chores pending” or “You’ve got 5 messages,” the interface carries small doses of joy. </p>
